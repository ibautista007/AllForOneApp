# AllForOneApp (Android Mobile App Developement Project)

## Overview for this app
When we started to think about the topic for our project, all the members wanted to create an application that would help people, then we realized that Canada has a lot of homeless people.

As we study homeless issues, we conclude that an app with information from homeless centers will be very productive for homeless people. Our application provides quick access to information and various functions can reduce your suffering.

Our purpose is to provide updated and fast information to people through a mobile application. Cell phones are an indispensable object for people, so we can help a large number of people with our all-in-one application.

## Summary of application features
Provide information that has been categorized by food, housing, and work using a map. The map will provide information on the location and how to contact those places.

Availability. Our application will keep accessible all essential information to our users.

Provide a current weather report that allows the user to choose the best feature for their needs.

The security feature will allow users to send a message to security contact. This message will be delivered to the emergency crews

## Conclusion
Today, technology is available to everyone in the world, but there is still a high percentage of people who need help with information about where to live, where to eat, where to work. As developers, we believe it is important not to forget the most vulnerable people and their needs. Searching for help is not an easy task, so we created this app to help homeless people find it.
The listed functions are simple and intuitive for the user because each function was researched by the team to create a functional and quality app for the homeless.
Features such as Lifeguard or Panic Button are not present in other applications; therefore, it is a great advance to provide these features to the homeless or people who need them.
